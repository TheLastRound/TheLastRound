    <div class="story"> Marc, a forest ranger, returned home early one night to find his wife in bed with another man. Marc tried to clear his honor by fighting the stranger but was beaten. He ended up in the
    hospital and died of grief, despair, and hatred. Before he took his last breath, he swore to carry out his revenge even after death. Now he is in the house to take his revenge, making his last round.  </div>
